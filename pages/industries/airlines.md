"Leaders in pilot decision-making, organizational <br> culture, and flight path management"

"In the complex, high stakes world of aviation, understanding why
people make the decisions they do in the moment can mean the
difference between routine and risk.
<br />
<br />
At Presage, we specialize in uncovering the human,
organizational, and cultural factors behind this high stakes
decision-making. Our proprietary methodology blends
psychological insights, decades of operational expertise, and
data-driven analyses to reveal the unique factors influencing
pilots' behaviour in the moment. We look at everything from
behaviour and decision making in the flight deck, to alignment
and opportunities for enhancement in broader safety management
systems.
<br />
<br />
Our aviation work is led by seasoned industry professionals and
supported by doctoral-level research scientists with expertise
in methodological considerations and advanced analytics. We've
partnered with global leaders—including Air Canada, Lufthansa,
Delta, Citation Jets, Virgin, and the British Antarctic
Survey—to deliver cutting-edge assessments and interventions.
From our groundbreaking collaboration with Flight Safety
International on Go-Around Decision Making & Execution (GADM&E)
guidelines, to ongoing evaluations of pilot decision-making
across major airlines, our approach is always collaborative,
data-informed, and tailored to the unique operational realities
of our clients.
<br />
<br />
We're also at the forefront of innovation in aviation mental
health. We are currently working on a digital application to
support pilot wellbeing that will contribute to a healthier,
more sustainable approach to mental health in the industry."
