"Leaders in ATC decision-making and <br> organizational safety culture"

"In the dynamic, high-pressure environment of Air Traffic Control, effective decision-making and multitasking are not just essential—they are critical to maintaining safety.
<br>
<br>
At Presage, we specialize in uncovering the human, organizational, and cultural factors that shape how these decisions are made in real-time. Our proprietary methodology blends psychological insights,  operational understanding, and data-driven analyses to reveal the unique factors influencing Air Traffic Controllers’ management of the complexity, pressure, and risk inherent to their work. From split-second decisions in high-pressure scenarios to broader patterns in team dynamics and organizational safety culture, we look at everything to identify what is influencing safety outcomes.
<br>
<br>
Our work in ATC is driven by experienced industry professionals and supported by research scientists with expertise in analyzing human performance and systems-level risks. We've partnered with global leaders and regulatory bodies to deliver customized assessments and interventions focused on three key areas of impact: controller decision-making, organizational safety culture, and wellbeing.
<br>
<br>
Whether we’re conducting culture diagnostics, evaluating real-time decision processes, or designing proactive wellbeing initiatives, our approach is collaborative, data-informed, and grounded in the unique operational demands of Air Traffic Control."
