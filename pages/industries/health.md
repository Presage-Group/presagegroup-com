"Emerging leaders in organizational culture <br> related to mental health and wellbeing"

"At Presage, our work has long focused on uncovering the human, organizational, and cultural factors that shape critical decision-making under pressure. Our proprietary methodology blends psychological insights, operational understanding, and data-driven analyses to understand to reveal the unique factors influencing decision-making, and has proven effective in sectors including aviation/air traffic control, utilities, and transportation. Now, we're expanding its application to the health and wellness sector.
<br>
<br>
Our team includes subject matter experts in medicine, epidemiology, health sciences, and psychology, helping to adapt our proven methods to this vertical.  From supporting pilot mental health through the development of the industryâ€™s first mental health and emotional wellness app, to partnering with the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Aeronautics (WISA) to explore the human side of sustainability in aviation, our work is increasingly focused on understanding how psychological wellbeing, organizational culture, and existing industry structures intersect in complex environments.
<br>
<br>
As we extend our work into healthcare and related domains, our approach remains rooted in one core belief: that human sustainability (the mental, emotional, and organizational conditions that enable people to perform their best) is not a nice-to-have. It's essential."
