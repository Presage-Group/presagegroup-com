"Dick Karl has had two long time love affairs with two distinct professions: aviation and surgery. In both these complex, high stakes worlds, Dr. Karl has been specifically interested in safety. In 2005 Dr. Karl founded the Surgical Safety Institute that sought to help hospitals reduce error by using proven aviation techniques such as checklists, briefings, team training , call outs and read backs. After earning an ATP and a type rating in Lear Jets, Dick began flying commercially in a Lear 31 in 2010. In 2013, he quit the practice of surgery and was hired full time as a part 135 Cessna Citation 3 pilot."
