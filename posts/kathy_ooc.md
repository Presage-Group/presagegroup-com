Presage is thrilled to share that Kathy Fox has been named to be a Member of the Order of Canada.  The Order of Canada is the cornerstone and pinnacle award of the Canadian Honours System.  Presented by the Governor General, it recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation.  Members exemplify the Order’s motto: DESIDERANTES MELIOREM PATRIAM (“They desire a better country”).

Released from the office of the Governor General of Canada on December 31, 2025: 
"Aviator Kathleen Fox has made vital contributions to transportation safety for decades. As chair of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, she championed the development of policies and changes to regulations that reduced risks for all travellers. A trailblazing mentor, she has empowered women to pursue leadership roles in the field."

Presage is honoured that Kathy is also a key member of our team.  Congratulations Kathy, on such well-deserved recognition of all that you have done, and continue to do, for aviation in Canada!
