We are happy to announce that our new podcast series is now live on all major platforms.

The intention behind the project is to help share the importance of cultural awareness within a community and/or organization. Presage will help guide you to creating/sustaining that and much more.

You can look forward to some great content from the Presage Group’s team and exciting guest features.
