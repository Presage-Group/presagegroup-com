We’re back with another episode of The Presage Effect Podcast Ep.005.

The episode features our very own Subject Matter Expert, Michelle Morrissey.

This is a great overview on how The Presage Group engages with our clients. Additionally, it shines light on the importance of creating great company culture. We have to consistently engage the people in our organizations so we continue to understand how they think and feel while they’re ‘in the field’.
