{{ blog_header "Using Web APIs <br> in R Programming" "/assets/PresageLogo.png" }}

Presage uses Google Cloud products for powering many of our internal tools. Firestore database is one such product that enables data storage in a NOSQL database. We interact with Firestore using its REST API and developed an open-source R package <a href="https://github.com/Presage-Group/frstore">frstore</a> for this purpose.

<br>
<br>

We talked about `frstore` and Web APIs in general during our presentation at the useR! 2025 conference held August 8-10, 2025. Check out the slides <a href="https://dru.quarto.pub/web-apis/">here</a>.
