Presage has completed our work with BAS (British Antarctic Survey), which included a Multiple Flight Operations Scientific Study to assist in the safe entry into service (EIS) of the Dash-8-314 aircraft into BAS’ unique operating environment in Rothera, Antarctica.

We used a three-pronged, mixed methods approach to complete a Multiple Flight Operations Scientific Study (MFOSS), including a preliminary operational evaluation, a review of operational safety data, and semi-structured interviews.

The goal of the MFOSS is to identify, quantify and mitigate the psychological, interpersonal, operational, and cultural factors that drive non-compliant decision-making.

Three structural pillars of the BAS organization emerged through both field observations and in-depth interviews
conducted among BAS personnel: pilot persona considerations, operational integrity, safety and leadership culture.

Following extensive data collection, working groups were conducted with members of BAS and PGI where proposed actions and recommendations were developed collaboratively.

The SOPs have been readily adopted by the pilots and
have proven to be robust and effective. In particular, pilots have 'bought into' the concepts in a way that
they previously didn't.
