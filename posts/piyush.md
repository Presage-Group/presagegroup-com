Piyush Gandhi, MBA, Captain

We are thrilled to announce that Piyush Gandhi has joined the Presage Group as Vice President, Operations and Business Development.

Previously, Piyush was the Chief Pilot & Customer Liaison Pilot/test pilot at Bombardier. He was a founding team member at Porter Airlines, rising to the roll of Vice President, Flight Operations. He then joined Sunwing Airlines as their Vice President, Flight Operations (and B737 Captain).

Piyush is on the Board of Directors for The Redwood (shelter for women fleeing abuse) and the Northern Lights Aero Foundation. Piyush founded/chaired the Y.A.Y! (You Are You!) D&I committee at Sunwing and he also co-founded/chaired the Women Soar at Porter program. Piyush has also served on various college and university Advisory Boards.

Piyush graduated from the Seneca Aviation Program (Class â€™93) and earned an MBA at the Rotman School of Business (University of Toronto) in 2014.

As a former customer at both Porter and Sunwing, Piyush fully understands and appreciates how a Presage intervention can positively impact an organization. At Presage, Piyush will utilize his skills, experience, and business acumen working directly with existing customers and developing new customers both in the aviation sector and other business verticals.

Welcome Piyush!
