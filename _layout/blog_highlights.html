                    The Presage solution looks at people – the core of
                    behavioural risk management. As experts in high-risk
                    decision making and reducing human error, we work with your
                    organization to find out who is at risk, why they are at
                    risk, and what you need to change or enhance to keep them
                    safe and compliant. Our team consists of doctoral level
                    research scientists who specialize in making methodological
                    considerations and statistical analysis frameworks that are
                    tailored to our clients’ needs. Our Subject Matter Experts
                    (SMEs) boast years of experience in high-risk professions
                    including aviation and aerospace, utilities and trades, and
                    health and medicine.
